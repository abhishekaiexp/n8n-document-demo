# Technical Design Document: Member Facing Proactive Outreach Campaign Dashboard

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical design for the new dashboard intended to monitor member-facing proactive outreach campaigns. The dashboard will provide a comprehensive view of campaign performance, member engagement, and key metrics to enable data-driven decision-making and optimization of outreach efforts.

## 2. System Overview

The Member Facing Proactive Outreach Campaign Dashboard will be a web-based application designed to aggregate, process, and visualize data related to member outreach campaigns. It will consume data from various internal systems, process it, and present it through an intuitive user interface with various filters and drill-down capabilities.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   Display key campaign metrics: reach, impressions, engagement rate, conversion rate, opt-out rate.
*   Allow filtering by campaign name, date range, outreach channel (email, SMS, push notification).
*   Provide drill-down capabilities to view performance by segment or individual member (anonymized/aggregated for privacy).
*   Visualize trends over time for various metrics.
*   Generate exportable reports in common formats (CSV, PDF).
*   Display real-time or near real-time updates for active campaigns.
*   Alerts for anomalies or performance deviations (future phase).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** Dashboard pages should load within 3 seconds for standard queries. Data refresh rate should be configurable (e.g., every 5-10 minutes).
*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle an increasing number of campaigns and data volume without significant performance degradation.
*   **Security:** Adhere to company's security policies, including data encryption in transit and at rest, secure authentication (SSO integration), and role-based access control.
*   **Usability:** Intuitive user interface, easy navigation, and clear data representation.
*   **Maintainability:** Modular design, well-documented code, and easy to deploy and update.
*   **Reliability:** High availability with minimal downtime.

## 5. Architecture

The dashboard will follow a layered architecture, leveraging existing data infrastructure where possible and introducing new components for specific dashboard needs.

### 5.1. Data Sources

*   **Campaign Management System:** Provides campaign definitions, schedules, and target audience data.
*   **CRM System:** Contains member profiles and historical interaction data.
*   **Marketing Automation Platform:** Logs outreach events (sent, delivered, opened, clicked, responded, unsubscribed).
*   **Internal Data Warehouse:** Serves as the central repository for consolidated and historical data from various sources.

### 5.2. Data Ingestion & ETL

Existing ETL pipelines will push raw campaign and member interaction data into the **Internal Data Warehouse**. A new dedicated ETL process will be developed to:

*   Extract relevant campaign and engagement data from the Data Warehouse.
*   Transform this data into an optimized schema suitable for reporting and analytical queries.
*   Load the transformed data into a dedicated **Dashboard Database (PostgreSQL)**, specifically designed for fast query performance for the dashboard UI.

### 5.3. Data Storage

*   **Internal Data Warehouse:** Primary long-term storage for raw and historical data.
*   **Dashboard Database (PostgreSQL):** An OLAP-optimized relational database for aggregated and pre-calculated metrics, serving as the primary data source for the dashboard's backend.

### 5.4. Backend Services (API Layer)

*   Developed using **Python (Flask/Django)**.
*   Provides RESTful APIs to the frontend for retrieving campaign data, metrics, and aggregated reports.
*   Handles authentication and authorization logic.
*   Interfaces with the Dashboard Database to fetch and process data requests.
*   Includes business logic for calculating derived metrics and applying filters.

### 5.5. Frontend (UI Layer)

*   Developed using **ReactJS** for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
*   Utilizes charting libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js, Recharts) for data visualization.
*   Communicates with the Backend API to fetch and display data.
*   Manages user interactions, filters, and drill-down functionalities.

### 5.6. Deployment

*   **Cloud Platform:** AWS (Amazon Web Services).
*   **Backend:** Deployed on **AWS EC2 instances** or as a containerized application using **AWS ECS/Fargate**.
*   **Database:** **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)** for the Dashboard Database.
*   **Frontend:** Served from **AWS S3** and distributed via **AWS CloudFront** for global content delivery.
*   **CI/CD:** Leveraging **AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild** for automated build, test, and deployment workflows.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** **AWS CloudWatch** for system metrics, logs, and alarms.

## 6. Data Model (Dashboard Database - PostgreSQL)

### `campaigns` Table

*   `campaign_id` (PK, UUID)
*   `campaign_name` (VARCHAR)
*   `campaign_type` (VARCHAR)
*   `start_date` (DATE)
*   `end_date` (DATE)
*   `status` (VARCHAR)
*   `channel` (VARCHAR) - e.g., 'Email', 'SMS', 'Push'

### `campaign_metrics_daily` Table

*   `metric_id` (PK, UUID)
*   `campaign_id` (FK, UUID)
*   `metric_date` (DATE)
*   `total_reach` (INT)
*   `total_impressions` (INT)
*   `total_opens` (INT)
*   `total_clicks` (INT)
*   `total_conversions` (INT)
*   `total_opt_outs` (INT)
*   `engagement_rate` (DECIMAL)
*   `conversion_rate` (DECIMAL)
*   `opt_out_rate` (DECIMAL)

### `member_interactions` Table (Aggregated/Anonymized)

*   `interaction_id` (PK, UUID)
*   `campaign_id` (FK, UUID)
*   `member_segment` (VARCHAR) - Anonymized segment ID or type
*   `interaction_date` (DATE)
*   `interaction_type` (VARCHAR) - e.g., 'Open', 'Click', 'Convert'

## 7. Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python 3.9+, Flask/Django REST Framework
*   **Frontend:** ReactJS 18+, React Router, Axios, D3.js / Recharts for charting
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL 14+
*   **ETL:** Custom Python scripts, potentially leveraging Apache Airflow for orchestration
*   **Deployment:** AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront, ECS/Fargate, CloudWatch, CodePipeline)
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## 8. API Endpoints

### `GET /api/campaigns`
*   Returns a list of all active/historical campaigns with basic details.

### `GET /api/campaigns/{campaign_id}/metrics`
*   Parameters: `start_date`, `end_date`, `interval` (daily, weekly, monthly)
*   Returns daily/weekly/monthly aggregated metrics for a specific campaign within the given date range.

### `GET /api/campaigns/summary`
*   Parameters: `start_date`, `end_date`, `channel`
*   Returns aggregated metrics across all campaigns or filtered campaigns.

### `GET /api/health`
*   Returns system health status.

## 9. Security Considerations

*   **Authentication:** Integrate with existing SSO (Single Sign-On) solution for user authentication.
*   **Authorization:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain data or functionalities based on user roles.
*   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt data in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (AWS RDS encryption, file system encryption).
*   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).
*   **Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to database users and application roles.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan application code and infrastructure for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Auditing and Logging:** Comprehensive logging of all access and data modifications for audit purposes.

## 10. Deployment Strategy

*   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying code changes to various environments (Dev, QA, Prod).
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to define and provision infrastructure, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
*   **Containerization:** Leverage Docker for packaging the backend application, ensuring consistent environments.
*   **Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive monitoring using AWS CloudWatch for application performance, resource utilization, and error rates.
*   **Alerting:** Set up alerts for critical issues and performance degradation.
*   **Logging:** Centralized logging using AWS CloudWatch Logs or a dedicated logging solution for easier debugging and troubleshooting.
*   **Blue/Green Deployment:** Consider for zero-downtime deployments in production.

## 11. Future Enhancements

*   Integration with anomaly detection systems for proactive alerts.
*   Machine learning models for predicting campaign performance.
*   Integration with A/B testing tools.
*   Customizable dashboards for different user roles.
*   Enhanced drill-down to individual member journey (with strict privacy controls).
