# Feature Specification: Campaign Monitoring Dashboard

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the feature specification for a comprehensive Campaign Monitoring Dashboard designed to provide real-time insights and analytical capabilities for healthcare insurance campaign performance, with an initial focus on the A1C test reminder campaign for diabetic members. The dashboard aims to empower stakeholders with the ability to monitor key metrics, visualize trends, and drill down into granular data for informed decision-making and campaign optimization.

## 2. Dashboard Features

### 2.1. Real-time Metrics
The dashboard shall display real-time data for crucial campaign interaction metrics specifically for the A1C test reminder campaign. "Real-time" is defined as data refreshed within 5 minutes of occurrence.

*   **Messages Sent:** Total number of A1C reminder messages dispatched.
*   **Messages Opened:** Total number of A1C reminder messages opened by members.
*   **Messages Responded To:** Total number of members who responded to the A1C reminder message (e.g., clicked a link to schedule, confirmed receipt, or engaged with a call-to-action).

### 2.2. Visualizations
The dashboard will incorporate a variety of visualization types to present data effectively.

*   **Line Graphs:**
    *   Trends over time for messages sent, opened, and responded to.
    *   A1C test completion rates over time.
    *   Member engagement trends.
*   **Bar Charts:**
    *   Comparison of campaign performance metrics across different member segments (e.g., age groups, health plan types).
    *   Comparison of A1C test completion rates by intervention type.
    *   Breakdown of comorbidities among target members.
*   **Gauge Charts:**
    *   Progress towards A1C test completion rate targets.
    *   Current open rate against target open rate.
    *   Current response rate against target response rate.
*   **KPI Cards:**
    *   Total Messages Sent (A1C campaign).
    *   Current Open Rate (A1C campaign).
    *   Current Response Rate (A1C campaign).
    *   Overall A1C Test Completion Rate (for members in the campaign).
    *   Number of Members Enrolled in Campaign.
*   **Scatter Plots:**
    *   Correlation between intervention type and response rate.
    *   Relationship between A1C baseline and A1C test completion status.
    *   Impact of socioeconomic status on response or completion rates.
*   **Geographic Maps:**
    *   Visualization of regional campaign performance (e.g., messages sent, open rates, A1C test completion rates by state, county, or region).
    *   Identification of geographical areas with high/low engagement.

### 2.3. Drill-down Capabilities
Users will be able to click on high-level data points (e.g., a specific segment's bar in a chart, a state on a map) to access more granular information. This includes:

*   Viewing individual member engagement histories within a selected segment.
*   Breaking down aggregate metrics by sub-categories (e.g., from state to county, from age group to specific age ranges).
*   Accessing detailed campaign performance reports for specific timeframes or filters.

### 2.4. Filtering Options
Robust filtering mechanisms will be provided to allow users to customize their data view.

*   **Timeframe:** Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly, Custom Date Range.
*   **Geographic Location:** State, County, Region (based on health plan definitions).
*   **Health Plan Type:** (e.g., HMO, PPO, POS, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid).
*   **Member Demographics:**
    *   Age Group (e.g., 18-30, 31-50, 51-65, 65+).
    *   Gender.
    *   Ethnicity.
    *   Socioeconomic Status (e.g., income brackets, education level - based on available data).
*   **Campaign Specifics:**
    *   Campaign Enrollment Status (e.g., Enrolled, Opt-out).
    *   A1C Baseline Before Intervention (e.g., specific HbA1c values or ranges).
    *   Intervention Type (e.g., SMS, Email, Mail, Nurse Call, Digital Health Program).
    *   A1C Test Completion Status (e.g., Completed, Not Completed, Scheduled).
*   **Comorbidities:** Filter by specific chronic conditions (e.g., Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Renal Disease).

## 3. Data Availability and Integration

All data fields required for the dashboard features are confirmed to be available and accessible. Integration points will be established with the following source systems:

*   **CRM (Customer Relationship Management):** Member demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status), health plan type, and member contact information.
*   **EHR (Electronic Health Records):** A1C baseline values, A1C test completion status, and comorbidities.
*   **Claims Data Systems:** Confirmation of A1C test completion through claims submissions.
*   **Campaign Management System:** Messages sent, messages opened, messages responded to, campaign enrollment status, and intervention type.
*   **Member Engagement Platform:** Detailed interaction data for messages (clicks, opens, responses).

**Assumptions regarding data:**
*   Data quality and consistency across integrated systems are sufficient for reporting.
*   Unique member identifiers exist across all systems to enable data linking.
*   API endpoints or data extracts are available for real-time and historical data retrieval.

## 4. Assumptions
*   **User Roles:** The dashboard will cater to various user roles (e.g., campaign managers, data analysts, clinical operations leads), with appropriate access controls implemented.
*   **Data Latency:** "Real-time" refers to a maximum data refresh delay of 5 minutes for operational metrics; analytical data may have longer refresh cycles (e.g., hourly/daily).
*   **Response Definition:** "Messages Responded To" includes any measurable engagement indicating a positive action towards the campaign's goal (e.g., link clicks, form submissions, appointment scheduling through integrated tools).
*   **Target Definitions:** Targets for gauge charts are configurable by administrators.

## 5. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial Release)
*   Predictive analytics for campaign success.
*   A/B testing result comparisons directly within the dashboard.
*   Integration with external public health data for broader context.
*   Automated alert notifications based on predefined thresholds.
