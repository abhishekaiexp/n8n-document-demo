## Cost Calculation

*   **Assumed Blended Rate**: $100 per hour (This rate is illustrative and subject to actual resource costs).
*   **Total Cost**: 680 hours * $100/hour = $68,000

## Assumptions

*   Access to all necessary data sources will be provided in a timely manner.
*   Clear requirements will be finalized at the start of the project.
*   Existing infrastructure and tools are adequate for dashboard deployment, or minor setup is included within the estimated deployment time.
*   Stakeholder availability for feedback and UAT is consistent throughout the project.
