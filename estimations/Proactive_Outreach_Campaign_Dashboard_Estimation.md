# Estimation for Proactive Outreach Campaign Dashboard

## Project Overview
This estimation outlines the effort, timeline, and cost associated with developing a new dashboard to monitor a member-facing proactive outreach campaign. The dashboard will provide key performance indicators (KPIs), engagement metrics, and insights into campaign effectiveness.

## Scope of Work
The development of the dashboard will encompass the following key areas:

1.  **Requirements Gathering & Design:**
    *   Detailed business requirements documentation.
    *   UI/UX wireframing and prototyping.
    *   Technical architecture design.
    *   Data model definition.
2.  **Data Integration & Backend Development:**
    *   Establishing data connections with outreach platforms, CRM systems, and other relevant data sources.
    *   Developing robust APIs for data ingestion and processing.
    *   Designing and implementing the database schema for aggregated campaign data.
    *   Implementing data transformation and aggregation logic.
3.  **Frontend Development:**
    *   Developing interactive and intuitive dashboard user interfaces.
    *   Implementing various data visualizations (charts, graphs, tables).
    *   Developing filtering, drill-down, and reporting functionalities.
4.  **Testing & Quality Assurance:**
    *   Unit testing and integration testing of all components.
    *   System testing and performance testing.
    *   User Acceptance Testing (UAT) support.
5.  **Deployment & Go-Live:**
    *   Setting up the production environment.
    *   Deployment of the application and configuration.
    *   Post-launch monitoring and initial support.
