# Campaign Strategy: A1C Test Overdue Members

## 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines a multi-channel marketing campaign strategy aimed at engaging diabetic members who are overdue for their A1C test. The goal is to improve health outcomes by encouraging timely testing, leveraging a mix of direct and indirect communication methods for maximum reach and effectiveness.

## 2. Campaign Goal
To increase the rate of A1C test completion among diabetic members identified as overdue, thereby promoting better diabetes management and preventative care.

## 3. Target Audience
Diabetic members who have been identified through our systems as overdue for their recommended A1C blood test.

## 4. Key Message
"Your A1C test is an important part of managing your diabetes and staying healthy. It's time to schedule your test."

**Sub-messages:**
*   Easy ways to schedule (online, phone).
*   Benefits of regular monitoring.
*   Support and resources available.

## 5. Communication Channels Strategy
Leveraging a multi-pronged approach to ensure comprehensive reach and engagement.

### a. SMS/Text Messages (Direct & Immediate)
*   **Usage:** Short, concise reminders with a direct link or phone number to schedule. Ideal for urgent follow-ups.
*   **Frequency:** Initial reminder, followed by one or two follow-up texts if no action is taken.

### b. Email Marketing (Detailed & Informative)
*   **Usage:** Personalized emails explaining the importance of the A1C test, step-by-step instructions for scheduling, FAQs, and links to educational resources.
*   **Content:** Infographics, testimonials (if appropriate), clear call-to-actions.
*   **Reach Context:** An email-only approach is estimated to reach approximately 40-60% of our target audience, depending on email consent rates and deliverability. This campaign aims to significantly expand on that reach.

### c. Direct Mail (Traditional & Tangible)
*   **Usage:** Postcards or letters for members who may not be highly digitally engaged or as a supplementary reminder.
*   **Content:** Simple, clear message about the A1C test importance, how to schedule, and contact information.

### d. Member Portal Notifications (In-Platform Engagement)
*   **Usage:** Prominent alerts or banners within the member's online portal upon login, directing them to information about their overdue test and scheduling options.
*   **Integration:** Potentially integrate a direct scheduling link within the notification.

### e. Outbound Calls (Personalized & High-Impact)
*   **Usage:** Targeted calls from care coordinators or nurses for members who have not responded to other channels, or for those identified as high-risk.
*   **Objective:** Address barriers to testing, offer assistance with scheduling, and provide personalized support.

### f. Social Media (Targeted Awareness & Education)
*   **Usage:** Geo-targeted and interest-based ads on platforms like Facebook/Instagram, promoting general diabetes management and the importance of regular A1C testing.
*   **Content:** Educational videos, infographics, success stories (anonymized).
*   **Note:** This channel is for broader awareness and reinforcement, not direct one-to-one outreach for overdue members.

### g. Pharmacy Partnerships (Point-of-Care Reminder)
*   **Usage:** Collaborate with partner pharmacies to display informational posters, distribute flyers, or provide brief verbal reminders to diabetic members picking up related prescriptions.
*   **Content:** Simple reminder about A1C testing, often with a QR code or brief instructions for scheduling.

## 6. Call to Action
*   "Schedule your A1C test today!"
*   "Call [Phone Number] to book your test."
*   "Visit [Website Link] to find a testing center."

## 7. Metrics & Success Measurement
While real-time access to metrics is desired (messages sent, opened, responded to, completed tests), our strategy will aim to track:
*   Number of A1C tests completed by target members.
*   Engagement rates for each channel (e.g., email open rates, click-through rates, call volume).
*   Reduction in the number of overdue members.

## 8. High-Level Campaign Timeline (Example)
*   **Week 1-2:** Internal Coordination & Data Segmentation, Message Finalization.
*   **Week 3-4:** Initial SMS & Email Deployment, Member Portal Notifications Live.
*   **Week 5-6:** Direct Mail Dispatch, Outbound Calls Commence.
*   **Ongoing:** Social Media Campaign, Pharmacy Partnership Activation & Reinforcement.
*   **Monthly:** Performance Review & Optimization.
