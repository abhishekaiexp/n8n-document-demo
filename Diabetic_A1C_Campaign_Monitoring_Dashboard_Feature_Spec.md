# Feature Specification: Diabetic A1C Campaign Monitoring Dashboard

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a new "Diabetic A1C Campaign Monitoring Dashboard." The primary objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive, real-time view of the performance and effectiveness of the Diabetic A1C outreach campaign. It will enable stakeholders to monitor key metrics, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize future campaign strategies and improve member engagement and health outcomes.

## 2. Key Metrics
The dashboard will prominently display the following key performance indicators (KPIs) for each targeted plan and region:

### 2.1. Total Messages Sent
*   **Definition**: The aggregate count of all outreach attempts made to members as part of the Diabetic A1C campaign.
*   **Breakdown**: This metric will be segmented by communication channel, including:
    *   Mailers (physical mail)
    *   Automated Calls (IVR/outbound dialer)
    *   Email
    *   SMS (text messages)

### 2.2. Total Messages Opened/Engaged
*   **Definition**: The count of messages that have demonstrated a level of recipient engagement or successful delivery confirmation.
*   **Examples by Channel**: 
    *   **Email**: Email open rates (tracked via pixel loads), click-through rates.
    *   **Automated Calls**: Call completion rates (e.g., member listened to full message, pressed a key).
    *   **SMS**: Delivery confirmation receipts.
    *   **Mailers**: Confirmation of mailer receipt (if trackable via postal service APIs or return acknowledgments).

### 2.3. Total Responses Received
*   **Definition**: The count of desired actions taken by members in response to the campaign's call to action.
*   **Examples of Responses**: 
    *   Appointments scheduled for A1C testing.
    *   Members indicating intent to get tested (e.g., via survey response, call center interaction).
    *   Return calls to a dedicated campaign hotline.
    *   Completion of online forms or surveys related to A1C testing.

## 3. Targeted Plans and Regions
The dashboard will specifically track and display performance for the following predefined combinations of plans and regions:

1.  **PremierChoice HMO plan in the Mid-Atlantic Region**
2.  **ValueCare PPO plan in the Southwest Region**

Each of the key metrics (Messages Sent, Messages Opened/Engaged, Responses Received) will be available for these specific combinations.

## 4. Data Sources
The data for the dashboard will be consolidated from various internal and external systems. Assumed primary data sources include:

*   **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System**: For member demographics, contact information, and communication preferences.
*   **Communication Platforms**: 
    *   **Email Marketing Platform (e.g., Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Mailchimp)**: Provides data on email sends, opens, clicks, and unsubscribes.
    *   **SMS Gateway/Platform**: Provides data on SMS sends, deliveries, and read receipts (if available).
    *   **Automated Call (IVR) System**: Provides call initiation, completion, duration, and key press data.
    *   **Print/Mailer Vendor System**: Provides data on mailer dispatch and, if feasible, delivery confirmations via API integration.
*   **Appointment Scheduling System**: Tracks scheduled appointments by members, linked to campaign codes.
*   **Claims/Electronic Health Record (EHR) System**: To validate completed A1C tests for members who responded, enabling reconciliation of actual test completions.
*   **Internal Call Center Logs/CRM Interaction Logs**: For tracking inbound calls or documented member responses received via phone.

## 5. Data Refresh Rate
The dashboard data should be refreshed **daily**, ideally by **6:00 AM EST**, to provide stakeholders with the most up-to-date campaign performance insights. This frequency allows for timely monitoring and reaction to campaign trends.

## 6. User Roles and Permissions
Access to the dashboard will be controlled based on defined user roles with specific permissions, primarily read-only access for most:

*   **Product Owners (TPO)**: View, Analyze.
*   **Marketing Team (Campaign Managers, Specialists)**: View, Analyze.
*   **Data Analysts**: View, Analyze, Export data for deeper analysis.
*   **Business Operations Leadership**: View (high-level summaries and trends).
*   **Executive Leadership**: View (summary performance metrics).

All roles will have read-only access to prevent accidental data modification. Export functionality for raw or aggregated data may be provided to specific roles (e.g., Data Analysts).

## 7. Potential Visualization Types
The dashboard will leverage various visualization types to effectively present the campaign data:

*   **Historical Trends (Line Charts)**: To visualize metrics (e.g., Messages Sent, Responses Received) over time, showing campaign progression and impact.
*   **Comparison Charts (Bar Charts, Pie Charts)**: To compare performance across different communication channels, or to compare the two targeted plan/region combinations against each other.
*   **Funnel Charts**: To illustrate the conversion rates from messages sent to messages opened/engaged to responses received.
*   **Scorecards/Gauge Charts**: To display current values for key metrics against predefined targets or benchmarks.
*   **Geographic Heatmaps/Maps**: If future expansions include more regions, to visually represent regional performance at a glance.
*   **Data Tables**: For detailed, granular data views, allowing users to drill down into specific metrics by date, channel, or member segment.

## 8. Assumptions
*   **Data Integration**: Assumed existence and accessibility of APIs or established data pipelines from all mentioned data sources to a central data warehouse or analytics platform.
*   **Mailer Tracking**: Tracking mailer receipt confirmation is assumed to be technically feasible through vendor integration or a reliable manual process.
*   **Response Definition**: A clear, consistent, and trackable definition of "responses received" (e.g., specific event codes, system flags) will be established by business stakeholders.
*   **Scalability**: The dashboard infrastructure will be scalable to accommodate potential future expansion to more plans, regions, or campaign types.
*   **Security**: All data displayed will adhere to HIPAA compliance and internal data privacy policies.
