# Feature Specification: Campaign Monitoring Dashboard

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The primary objective of the Campaign Monitoring Dashboard is to provide healthcare insurance stakeholders (e.g., marketing, outreach, and analytics teams) with a centralized, real-time, and historical view of campaign performance. This dashboard will specifically focus on engagement metrics related to our member outreach efforts, enabling data-driven insights to inform and optimize future outreach strategies and ultimately improve member engagement and health outcomes.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1. Real-time Engagement Metrics

The dashboard shall display the following key engagement metrics, updated near-instantaneously (refer to Technical Considerations for refresh rate):

*   **Number of Emails Sent:** Total count of emails successfully dispatched for active campaigns.
*   **Number of Emails Opened:** Total count of unique email opens.
*   **Number of Emails Responded To:** This metric encompasses various call-to-action (CTA) engagements, including but not limited to:
    *   Clicks on embedded links.
    *   Form submissions originating from campaign emails.
    *   Downloads of linked resources.

### 2.2. Historical Data Analysis

Users must have the capability to analyze past campaign performance trends. The system shall allow users to select and view data over definable periods, including:

*   Daily trends
*   Weekly trends
*   Monthly trends
*   Quarterly trends
*   Custom date range selection (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, specific calendar range).

### 2.3. Robust Filtering Capabilities

To enable granular analysis, the dashboard will offer comprehensive filtering options:

*   **By Campaign:**
    *   Ability to select one or multiple specific campaigns for analysis.
    *   Option to view aggregate data across all campaigns.
*   **By Channel:**
    *   Dedicated filter to specifically track and display data for the 'Email' communication channel. (Future consideration may include other channels like SMS, Push Notifications).
*   **By Demographic:**
    *   **Age:** Filter by specific age ranges (e.g., 18-24, 25-34, 65+, etc.).
    *   **Gender:** Filter by male, female, or unspecified.
    *   **Location:** Filter by geographic attributes:
        *   State
        *   City
        *   Zip Code
    *   **Specific Health Conditions:** Filter by identified health conditions of members (e.g., Diabetes, Hypertension, Asthma, COPD, Heart Disease, etc., as per available data).
    *   **All Other Available Demographic Attributes:** The system should support filtering by any other relevant demographic attributes present in our member database (e.g., Plan Type, Enrollment Status, etc.) as they become available or relevant.

### 2.4. Intuitive Data Visualization

The dashboard will utilize a variety of intuitive charts and graphs to present data effectively:

*   **Line Charts:** For visualizing trends over time (e.g., emails sent daily, open rate over weeks).
*   **Bar Charts:** For comparing metrics across different campaigns, demographic segments, or time periods.
*   **Pie Charts/Donut Charts:** For displaying distributions (e.g., email opens by gender, response rates by age group).
*   **Summary Cards:** Prominently display key real-time metrics (e.g., current open rate, total emails sent today).

## 3. Data Sources

The dashboard will integrate and consume data from the following authoritative sources:

*   **Campaign Management System:** Primary source for campaign definitions, IDs, and initial dispatch information.
*   **Email Service Provider (ESP) Logs:** Provides detailed logs for email delivery status, opens, clicks, and other engagement events.
*   **Member Demographic Database (MDD):** Source for all member-related demographic and health condition data required for filtering and segmentation.

## 4. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Considerations

*   **Clean and Intuitive Design:** The UI must be uncluttered, easy to understand, and visually appealing, minimizing cognitive load for users.
*   **Easy Navigation:** Clear navigation paths should allow users to quickly find the information they need and switch between different views or filters.
*   **Responsiveness:** The dashboard must be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes, including desktop monitors, laptops, and tablets, ensuring a consistent user experience.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Filters should be dynamic, updating charts instantly without page reloads. Hover-over tooltips should provide additional data details.

## 5. Technical Considerations and Assumptions

*   **Data Refresh Rate:** Real-time metrics should be updated with a near-instantaneous refresh rate, ideally every 5 minutes, to ensure stakeholders have the most current view of campaign performance. Historical data can be updated less frequently, e.g., hourly or daily batch processing.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** The underlying infrastructure must be highly scalable to accommodate a growing volume of campaign data, increasing member base, and an expanding number of concurrent users without performance degradation.
*   **Secure Access Control:** Access to the dashboard and its underlying data must be governed by robust role-based access control (RBAC). User roles (e.g., Marketing Manager, Analyst) will determine data visibility and functional permissions. Sensitive member demographic data must be handled in compliance with HIPAA and other relevant data privacy regulations.
*   **Data Latency:** Data pipelines from source systems to the dashboard should be optimized for low latency, especially for real-time metrics.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Robust error handling and comprehensive logging should be implemented for data ingestion and dashboard rendering processes to facilitate debugging and maintenance.

## 6. Future Enhancements (Potential Roadmap Items)

*   **A/B Testing Integration:** Display results of A/B tests conducted within campaigns.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** Incorporate machine learning models to forecast campaign performance or identify members at risk of disengagement.
*   **Alerting System:** Notifications for significant deviations in campaign performance (e.g., sudden drop in open rates).
*   **Campaign ROI Tracking:** Integration with cost data to display Return on Investment for campaigns.
