## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the feature specification for the A1C Campaign Monitoring Dashboard. The primary purpose of this dashboard is to provide real-time monitoring and actionable insights into the performance of the A1C campaign, with a specific focus on the email communication channel. This campaign targets diabetic members who are overdue for an A1C test, aiming to encourage test completion.

## 2. Goals

The core objective of this dashboard is to enable stakeholders (e.g., campaign managers, marketing analysts, product owners) to:
*   Monitor the A1C email campaign's performance in real-time.
*   Quickly identify trends and anomalies in email delivery, engagement, and response rates.
*   Inform decisions for optimizing future campaign iterations and member outreach strategies.

## 3. Key Metrics & Real-time Display

The dashboard shall prominently display the following key performance indicators (KPIs) for the email channel campaign. These metrics will be updated in near real-time (with a maximum refresh delay of 5 minutes, to be confirmed by data engineering).

### 3.1. Messages Sent
*   **Definition:** The total number of emails successfully dispatched to the targeted member cohort.
*   **Display:** A large, clear numerical display of the current count.
*   **Visual Trend:** A line chart showing the daily/hourly trend of messages sent over the selected period.

### 3.2. Messages Opened
*   **Definition:** The total number of unique emails opened by recipients. This metric signifies initial engagement.
*   **Display:** A large, clear numerical display of the current count, along with the "Open Rate" (Messages Opened / Messages Sent * 100%).
*   **Visual Trend:** A line chart showing the daily/hourly trend of messages opened and open rate over the selected period.

### 3.3. Messages Responded To
*   **Definition:** The total number of emails for which a positive response has been registered. A positive response is defined as:
    *   Click-through on a scheduling link.
    *   Reply to the email (if applicable).
    *   Completion of any other defined call-to-action (e.g., form submission for information, direct navigation to a health portal section related to A1C testing).
*   **Display:** A large, clear numerical display of the current count, along with the "Response Rate" (Messages Responded To / Messages Sent * 100%).
*   **Visual Trend:** A line chart showing the daily/hourly trend of messages responded to and response rate over the selected period.

## 4. Data Source

The primary data source for these metrics will be the organization's designated Email Marketing Platform (e.g., Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze, Mailchimp enterprise edition). This platform is assumed to be fully integrated with our internal Member Communication Records and capable of providing granular, real-time engagement data via robust APIs or secure data exports.

## 5. User Interface (UI) Considerations

The dashboard UI will prioritize intuitiveness, clarity, and actionable insights.

### 5.1. Dashboard Layout
*   **Overview Section:** A prominent section at the top displaying the three key metrics (Messages Sent, Opened, Responded To) as large, easy-to-read numbers, potentially with sparklines indicating immediate trends.
*   **Detailed Metrics Section:** Below the overview, dedicated sections for each metric with their respective trend charts.
*   **Filter Panel:** A collapsible or fixed panel on the left/top for filter controls.

### 5.2. Visualizations
*   **Trend Charts:** Line charts will be used to represent performance trends over time for all key metrics. These charts should be interactive, allowing hover-overs for specific data points.
*   **Progress Bars/Gauges:** Potentially used for displaying response rates against pre-defined targets (if targets are introduced in a future phase).
*   **Color Coding:** Consistent and clear color coding for different metrics across all visualizations.

### 5.3. Filters
The dashboard shall implement the following filter capabilities to allow for granular analysis:
*   **Date Range:**
    *   Pre-defined options: Last 24 hours, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Month-to-date, Year-to-date.
    *   Custom date picker: Users can select a specific start and end date.
*   **Campaign Segment:** If the A1C campaign has multiple distinct segments (e.g., by age group, previous A1C status, region), a dropdown filter to select a specific segment for analysis.
*   **Campaign Phase:** If the campaign runs in distinct phases (e.g., initial outreach, reminder 1, reminder 2), a dropdown filter to isolate data for a particular phase.

### 5.4. Interactivity
*   **Hover-overs:** Displaying exact numerical values on charts when hovering over data points.
*   **Drill-down (Future Consideration):** Potential for clicking on a metric to navigate to a more detailed report or a list of relevant member IDs (with appropriate privacy considerations).
*   **Data Export:** Option to export the displayed data in CSV or Excel format.

### 5.5. Responsiveness
The dashboard should be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices (desktop, tablet).

## 6. Technical Considerations

*   **Data Integration:** Establish robust API connections or secure ETL processes with the Email Marketing Platform to pull raw campaign activity data (send logs, open events, click events). Data transformation will occur to aggregate this raw data into the required metrics.
*   **Data Refresh:** Implement a data pipeline that ensures metric updates every 5 minutes or less, reflecting near real-time performance.
*   **Database:** A performant database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Snowflake) will store the aggregated campaign metrics, optimized for fast dashboard queries.
*   **Frontend Technology:** A modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) will be used for building the interactive UI.
*   **Backend API:** A secure backend API (e.g., Node.js, Python/Flask/Django, Java/Spring Boot) will serve data from the database to the frontend.
*   **Security:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized personnel can view the dashboard. All data transmissions must be encrypted.

## 7. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for V1.0)

*   **Conversion Tracking:** Integrate with our claims or EMR systems to track actual A1C test completion following email interaction.
*   **Cost Analysis:** Display campaign cost per message, cost per open, cost per response.
*   **A/B Testing Insights:** Visualize performance differences between different email variants.
*   **Alerts & Notifications:** Set up configurable alerts for significant drops in open/response rates or when targets are met.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** Incorporate machine learning models to forecast future campaign performance.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

*   All specified key metrics (Messages Sent, Opened, Responded To) are accurately calculated and displayed.
*   The dashboard updates data at least every 5 minutes without manual refresh.
*   All trend charts display data correctly for the selected date range.
*   All filter options (Date Range, Campaign Segment, Campaign Phase) function as expected, updating the displayed metrics accordingly.
*   The dashboard UI is intuitive, easy to navigate, and visually appealing.
*   The dashboard is accessible to authorized users only.
*   Error handling is in place for data retrieval failures, displaying appropriate messages to the user.
*   The dashboard is performant, loading data within acceptable timeframes (e.g., < 3 seconds for initial load, < 1 second for filter changes).
