## [Healthcare Company Name] Launches "Stay in Control" Campaign to Boost Diabetic A1C Test Adherence

**[CITY, STATE] – [Date]** – [Healthcare Company Name] today announced the launch of its new "Stay in Control: Your A1C Test Matters for a Healthier You!" campaign, a targeted initiative aimed at encouraging diabetic members to get their overdue A1C tests. This campaign underscores the company's commitment to improving healthcare quality, managing costs, and enhancing the overall member experience.

The A1C test is a critical diagnostic tool for individuals with diabetes, providing an average blood sugar level over the past two to three months. Regular A1C testing is essential for effective diabetes management, helping to prevent serious complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision loss.

"Our 'Stay in Control' campaign is a direct reflection of our dedication to our members' well-being and our strategic pillars of improving quality scores, managing healthcare costs, and delivering an exceptional member experience," said [Spokesperson's Name and Title, e.g., Dr. Emily Chen, Chief Medical Officer at Healthcare Company Name]. "By ensuring our diabetic members receive timely A1C tests, we are empowering them to better manage their condition, lead healthier lives, and ultimately reduce the burden of preventable complications."

The campaign will focus on specific populations and regions identified through detailed operational analysis where A1C test adherence rates can be significantly improved. These include:

*   **HMO Medicare Advantage Plans** in Clark County, NV, and Broward County, FL.
*   **Commercial PPO members** in rural/exurban Texas and Ohio.
*   **Urban low-income areas** like Southside Chicago, IL, and East Los Angeles, CA.
*   **Remote/Rural clusters** in the Appalachian Foothills of Kentucky.
*   **Medicaid Managed Care Plans** in California and New York.
*   **Southeastern U.S. "Diabetes Belt"** regions (parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina).

To facilitate easier access and encourage participation, [Healthcare Company Name] will implement a multi-faceted outreach strategy, including personalized communications via automated calls, SMS, and direct mail. Digital engagement will be enhanced through member portal notifications, targeted email campaigns, and social media initiatives. The company will also collaborate closely with healthcare providers to reinforce the importance of A1C testing and integrate reminders into patient care workflows.

Members are encouraged to schedule their A1C test today by calling [Phone Number], visiting [Website], or speaking with their doctor at their next appointment. For more information on diabetes management and the importance of A1C testing, please visit [Website URL to dedicated campaign page].
