# Estimation for New Member-Facing Proactive Outreach Campaign Dashboard

## 1. Introduction
This document provides an estimation for the development and deployment of a new dashboard designed to monitor a member-facing proactive outreach campaign. The dashboard will offer key insights into campaign performance, member engagement, and overall effectiveness.

## 2. Scope
The scope of this project includes:
*   Requirements gathering and detailed analysis of campaign metrics.
*   Identification and integration of relevant data sources (e.g., CRM, marketing automation platforms, customer service systems).
*   Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) pipeline development.
*   Design and development of interactive dashboard visualizations.
*   Implementation of data filtering, drill-down capabilities, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
*   Thorough testing and quality assurance.
*   Deployment to production environment.
*   User training and documentation.
