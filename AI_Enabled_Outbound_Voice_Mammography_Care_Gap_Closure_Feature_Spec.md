# Feature Name: AI-Enabled Outbound Voice for Mammography Care Gap Closure

## 1. Product Overview

This initiative aims to develop an AI-enabled outbound voice capability designed to proactively contact individuals who have been identified with a mammography care gap. The primary objective is to enhance patient engagement, educate them about the importance of mammography screenings, and facilitate the direct scheduling of appointments through an intuitive, automated voice interaction. This system will integrate with existing patient data and scheduling platforms to ensure a seamless and efficient process.

## 2. Primary Goals/KPIs

*   **Reduce mammography care gaps by 10% within the next fiscal year.** This will be measured by comparing the number of open care gaps before and after the implementation of this solution.
*   **Increase online mammography appointments by 25% within six months of deployment.** This will be tracked by monitoring appointments scheduled directly through the AI voice system's integration with the online portal/API.

## 3. Key Functionalities (Detailed User Stories)

### 3.1 Patient-Facing Functionalities

*   **P-001: Automated, Natural-Sounding Call:** As a patient, I want to receive an automated outbound call that uses a natural, empathetic, and clear AI voice to inform me of my mammography care gap, explaining the purpose of the call (e.g., overdue screening, preventative health) so I can understand why I am being contacted and feel comfortable engaging with the system.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The AI voice should sound human-like and avoid robotic tones.
        *   The initial greeting clearly identifies the caller (e.g., "This is [Insurance Company Name], calling on behalf of your healthcare provider...") and the purpose of the call (e.g., "regarding an important preventative screening for mammography").
        *   The AI provides a brief, understandable explanation of what a mammography care gap signifies.
*   **P-002: Guided Appointment Scheduling:** As a patient, I want the AI voice to clearly guide me through the steps to schedule a mammography appointment, offering real-time available dates and times based on my location or preferred facility so that I can easily find a suitable slot.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The AI offers options for "now," "later," or "transfer to human" for scheduling.
        *   If scheduling, the AI can present multiple available dates and times.
        *   The patient can express preferences like "next week," "mornings," or "a specific date."
        *   The AI confirms the selected date, time, and location verbally.
*   **P-003: Appointment Management Options:** As a patient, I want to be able to confirm, reschedule, or cancel a mammography appointment directly through the AI voice interaction or by being directed to a secure online portal (via SMS link) so that I have flexibility in managing my schedule.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   If an appointment is already scheduled, the AI can recognize this and offer options to confirm, reschedule, or cancel.
        *   For online portal redirection, the AI verbally provides a clear instruction and optionally sends an SMS with the link.
        *   Confirmation of actions (e.g., "Your appointment has been confirmed for...") is provided verbally.
*   **P-004: Seamless Human Agent Transfer:** As a patient, if I have questions the AI cannot answer, or if I prefer to speak with someone, I want to be seamlessly transferred to a qualified human agent or provided with clear instructions on how to get further assistance (e.g., a direct phone number) so that my concerns are fully addressed.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The AI can detect phrases indicating a need for human assistance (e.g., "I want to speak to someone," "I have a question").
        *   Upon transfer, relevant call context (e.g., patient ID, reason for call) is passed to the human agent.
        *   If transfer is not immediately possible, the AI provides an alternative contact method (e.g., "Please call our dedicated scheduling line at XXX-XXX-XXXX").

### 3.2 Administrator/System Functionalities

*   **A-001: Care Gap Identification:** As an administrator, I want the system to automatically identify individuals with mammography care gaps based on predefined criteria (e.g., age, last screening date, health plan rules) pulled from our EHR system, ensuring that outreach efforts are targeted and efficient.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The system can query the EHR/data warehouse for patients meeting the care gap criteria daily/weekly.
        *   Criteria are configurable by an authorized user (e.g., frequency of screening, age ranges).
        *   A list of eligible individuals is generated for outbound calling.
*   **A-002: Call Logging and Reporting:** As an administrator, I want the system to meticulously log all outbound call attempts, their outcomes (e.g., appointment scheduled, transferred to human, voicemail, no answer, busy), and reasons for failure (e.g., invalid number, patient declined) so I can monitor the effectiveness of the program and identify areas for improvement.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Each call attempt is timestamped and logged with its status.
        *   Detailed outcomes are captured (e.g., "Appointment Booked," "Transferred to Agent," "Voicemail Left," "Disconnected").
        *   Reasons for unsuccessful calls are recorded (e.g., "Patient Opted Out," "Line Busy," "Number Not In Service").
        *   Logs are accessible for reporting and auditing purposes.
*   **A-003: EHR and Scheduling System Integration:** As an administrator, I want the system to seamlessly integrate with our existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) and appointment scheduling systems to securely access patient demographic data, medical history relevant to screening, and to directly book or modify mammography appointments, ensuring data consistency and real-time updates.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The system can retrieve patient identifiers and care gap status from the EHR.
        *   The system can query the scheduling system for available appointment slots.
        *   The system can write new appointments or update existing ones back into the scheduling system with appropriate details (e.g., patient name, date, time, facility, procedure code).
        *   All data exchanges are secure and authenticated.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements & Considerations

*   **Security & Privacy (HIPAA Compliance):**
    *   All interactions involving Protected Health Information (PHI) must strictly adhere to HIPAA regulations and internal company data privacy policies.
    *   Data at rest and in transit must be encrypted.
    *   Access controls must be robust, with authentication and authorization mechanisms for all system users and integrations.
    *   Regular security audits and penetration testing will be required.
*   **AI Voice Quality:**
    *   The AI voice must be natural, empathetic, and clear, with appropriate pacing and intonation to ensure a positive and trustworthy patient experience.
    *   Accent and linguistic preferences should be configurable if applicable (e.g., English, Spanish).
*   **Conversational Flow (Natural Language Understanding - NLU):**
    *   The NLU component must be robust enough to accurately interpret various patient responses, including complex sentences, interruptions, common questions, and nuanced intentions.
    *   The system should be able to maintain context throughout the conversation.
    *   Ability to re-prompt or clarify misunderstood inputs effectively.
*   **Error Handling & Fallbacks:**
    *   The system must gracefully handle misunderstandings (e.g., "Sorry, I didn't get that, could you please repeat?").
    *   Robust mechanisms for dealing with technical issues (e.g., network outages, system unavailability) with clear pathways to human intervention or alternative solutions.
    *   Define escalation paths for unhandled queries or critical failures.
*   **Scalability:**
    *   The solution must be designed to handle a large volume of concurrent outbound calls, potentially thousands per day, without degradation in performance.
    *   The underlying infrastructure should be capable of elastic scaling.
*   **Integration:**
    *   Seamless, real-time integration with existing clinical systems (EHR/EMR), patient management platforms, and appointment scheduling systems via secure APIs (e.g., FHIR, custom APIs).
    *   Consideration for integration with CRM or patient engagement platforms if present.
*   **Reporting & Analytics:**
    *   Comprehensive dashboards and reports on key metrics: call outcomes, care gap closure rates, online appointment increases, patient engagement rates, transfer rates to human agents, and common patient queries.
    *   Ability to export data for further analysis.
*   **Opt-Out Mechanism:** Patients must have a clear and easy way to opt-out of future automated calls. The system must record and respect these opt-out preferences.

## 5. Assumptions

*   **Access to Care Gap Data:** A reliable, accurate, and regularly updated list of individuals identified with mammography care gaps, along with their contact information, is available and accessible for integration.
*   **Existing Online Scheduling/API:** A functional online appointment scheduling system or a well-documented API for direct booking/modification of mammography appointments is already in place and can be integrated with.
*   **Human Agent Capacity:** There is sufficient human agent capacity and a defined process for handling call transfers and escalations from the AI system.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** All necessary legal and compliance reviews for automated patient outreach have been conducted and approved.
*   **Data Security Permissions:** Required permissions and agreements for accessing and processing patient PHI from source systems are in place.
