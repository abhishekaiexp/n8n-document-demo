# Feature Specification: AI Tool Usage Tracking Web Application

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document outlines the feature specification for a new web application designed to provide comprehensive tracking, reporting, and analytics of AI tool usage within the company. The primary purpose is to offer insights into AI tool adoption, optimize resource allocation, manage costs effectively, and understand how various AI tools contribute to business operations.

## 2. Core Functionality

The application will automatically log key metrics for each AI tool usage event to ensure accurate and granular data collection.

### 2.1. Usage Logging Metrics

For every instance of AI tool usage, the following data points will be captured:

*   **AI Tool Used:** A unique identifier for the specific AI tool (e.g., "AI Assistant X", "Predictive Model Y", "Image Generator Z"). This should link to a configurable list of available tools.
*   **User:** The unique identifier of the user who initiated the AI tool usage (e.g., employee ID, username).
*   **Purpose:** A field specifying the reason for using the tool. This will be implemented as:
    *   A dropdown menu with predefined common categories (e.g., "Research", "Data Analysis", "Content Generation", "Code Review", "Customer Support", "Marketing Campaign").
    *   An "Other" text input option to allow users to specify reasons not covered by the dropdown.
*   **Frequency:** The number of times a specific user utilizes a particular tool within a defined session or timeframe, or the overall frequency of a tool's usage across all users.
*   **Duration:** The active duration of the AI tool usage session (e.g., time from invocation to completion, or active interaction time).
*   **Cost:** The associated monetary cost of the AI tool usage. This will integrate with internal cost models or external API billing systems. Costs should be granular enough to break down by individual usage events.
*   **Timestamp:** Automatic recording of when the AI tool usage event occurred (start and end times where applicable).
*   **Department/Project (Assumption):** If available through user profiles or direct input, the department or project associated with the user/usage will be logged for enhanced cost and usage analysis.

## 3. Reporting and Analytics

The application will provide a robust set of reporting and analytical capabilities to derive actionable insights from the collected usage data.

### 3.1. Dashboard View

A centralized, intuitive dashboard will serve as the primary interface, offering an immediate overview of key AI tool usage statistics.

### 3.2. Real-time Metrics

Display of current usage statistics, including:
*   Number of active users currently utilizing AI tools.
*   List of AI tools currently in use and by whom.
*   Real-time cost accumulation for ongoing sessions.

### 3.3. Historical Trends

Visualization of usage patterns over definable time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly) for all tracked metrics (usage count, duration, cost, by tool, by user). This will enable trend analysis and forecasting.

### 3.4. User-Specific Reports

Ability to filter and view detailed usage data per individual user, including:
*   List of AI tools used by the user.
*   Purpose of each tool usage.
*   Frequency of usage for each tool.
*   Total duration of usage per tool and overall.
*   Associated cost for each tool and total cost incurred by the user.

### 3.5. Tool-Specific Reports

Ability to filter and view detailed usage data per AI tool, including:
*   Overall adoption rate and usage count for the tool.
*   Most frequent users of the tool.
*   Common purposes for which the tool is utilized.
*   Total cost incurred by the tool across all users.
*   Usage trends over time for the specific tool.

### 3.6. Cost Analysis

Detailed breakdown of costs, with filtering and aggregation options:
*   Costs by individual AI tool.
*   Costs by user.
*   Costs by department (if logged).
*   Costs by project (if logged).
*   Historical cost trends and projections.
*   Ability to compare costs across different periods.

### 3.7. Export Functionality

Ability to export reports and raw data in common formats for further analysis or archiving (e.g., CSV, PDF, JSON).

### 3.8. Search and Filter

Comprehensive search and filtering capabilities across all logged metrics (e.g., filter by date range, user, tool name, purpose, cost range).

## 4. User Roles and Permissions

The application will implement a role-based access control system to ensure data security and appropriate access levels.

### 4.1. Admin Role

*   Full access to all AI tool usage data, reports, and analytics.
*   Ability to manage user accounts within the application and assign roles.
*   Ability to configure AI tools (add/remove tools, update tool identifiers, set or adjust cost parameters).
*   Ability to manage purpose categories.

### 4.2. Standard User Role

*   Ability to view their own personal AI tool usage history and associated costs.
*   Ability to view aggregated team/department usage if applicable and explicitly permissioned by an administrator.

## 5. Technical Considerations & Assumptions

### 5.1. Data Sources & Integration

*   The application will integrate with existing AI tools via their respective APIs or dedicated logging mechanisms to capture usage data automatically.
*   Cost data for AI tools will be obtained through integration with internal billing systems, external API usage costs, or predefined cost parameters configured per tool within the application.
*   User data (e.g., department, project) will ideally be sourced from existing company directories or HR systems if available, to enrich usage logs.

### 5.2. Data Management

*   **Data Refresh Rate:** Real-time metrics will be updated near-instantaneously (e.g., every 5 minutes for dashboard, or event-driven for individual logs).
*   **Scalability:** The architecture must be scalable to handle growing data volumes as AI tool usage increases across the company.
*   **Data Retention:** A data retention policy will be defined (e.g., 3-5 years) for historical usage data.

### 5.3. Security & Authentication

*   **Secure Access Control:** Access will be based on defined user roles with appropriate permissions.
*   **Authentication:** User authentication will leverage existing company Single Sign-On (SSO) systems where available. Otherwise, a standard, secure login system will be implemented.
*   **Data Privacy:** All sensitive usage data will be handled in compliance with company data privacy policies and relevant regulations.

### 5.4. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)

*   **Intuitive Design:** The web application will feature a clean, intuitive, and easy-to-navigate design.
*   **Responsiveness:** The UI will be responsive, ensuring optimal display and functionality across various screen sizes (desktop, laptop, tablet).
*   **Data Visualization:** Extensive use of intuitive charts and graphs (e.g., line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, pie charts for distributions) for effective data visualization.

## 6. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial Release)

*   Alerts and notifications for unusual usage patterns or cost thresholds.
*   Integration with project management tools for linking usage to specific tasks.
*   Predictive analytics for future cost and usage forecasting.
*   User feedback mechanisms for AI tools.
