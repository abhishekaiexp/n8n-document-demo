    *   Bar charts for channel breakdown and demographic comparisons.

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensure that only authorized personnel can view and interact with the dashboard, based on their roles within the organization.

## 5. Technical Considerations & Assumptions

*   **Data Sources:** Assumed integration with existing CRM, Marketing Automation, and Call Center systems where outreach data resides.

*   **Performance:** The dashboard must be performant, loading data and visualizations quickly, even with large datasets.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture should be scalable to accommodate growth in member outreach activities and data volume.
*   **Security:** Adherence to all relevant healthcare data security and privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA compliance).
*   **User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX):** Intuitive and user-friendly design to ensure ease of navigation and data interpretation.

## 6. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial Release)

*   Predictive analytics for campaign success.
*   A/B testing result integration.
*   Cost-per-acquisition (CPA) and Return on Investment (ROI) metrics.
*   Integration with external data sources (e.g., social media engagement).
*   Alerting and notification system for significant changes in campaign performance.
