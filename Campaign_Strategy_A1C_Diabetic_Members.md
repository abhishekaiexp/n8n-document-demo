# Campaign Strategy: A1C Test Adherence for Diabetic Members

## 1. Campaign Goal
To significantly increase the percentage of diabetic members on the Platinum Choice PPO plan in Metro City North and the Gold Standard HMO plan in Suburban County A who complete their overdue A1C tests, thereby improving health outcomes and reducing long-term complications.

## 2. Target Audience
*   **Primary Audience:** Diabetic members identified as overdue for their A1C test.
    *   **Segment 1:** Platinum Choice PPO members in Metro City North.
    *   **Segment 2:** Gold Standard HMO members in Suburban County A.

## 3. Communication Channels

### General Channels (Applicable to both segments):

*   **Direct Mail:** Personalized letters or postcards with clear instructions and benefits of testing. Will include a tear-off section or QR code for easy response.
*   **Email Marketing:** Segmented email campaigns with compelling subject lines (e.g., "Important Health Update: Your A1C Test Reminder"). Content will highlight the importance, simplicity, and benefits of getting tested. Includes direct links to scheduling or finding providers.
*   **SMS/Text Messaging:** Concise, action-oriented reminders (e.g., "Time for your A1C test. Protect your health. Reply YES to schedule or visit [Link]"). Used for initial reminders and follow-ups.
*   **Member Portal/App Notifications:** Prominent banners, alerts, and personalized messages within the member portal or mobile app directing members to A1C testing information, in-network provider search, and scheduling tools.
*   **Outbound Calls:** For members who do not respond to digital or mail efforts, a follow-up call from a care coordinator or nurse to offer assistance, answer questions, and facilitate scheduling.
*   **Collaboration with Primary Care Providers (PCPs):** Provide PCPs with patient lists of overdue members, educational materials, and a clear process for them to reinforce the message during appointments or through their own practice management systems.

### Segment-Specific Channel Considerations:

*   **Platinum Choice PPO (Metro City North):** Given potential higher digital engagement, emphasize email and member portal notifications. Ensure online provider directories are prominently linked. Leverage the PPO's flexibility by highlighting various in-network testing locations.
*   **Gold Standard HMO (Suburban County A):** Stronger emphasis on direct mail and PCP collaboration due to the direct relationship with the assigned medical group. Outbound calls are crucial for members who prefer personal interaction or need assistance navigating the HMO system for scheduling.
