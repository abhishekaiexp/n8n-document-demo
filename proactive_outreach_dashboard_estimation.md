# Estimation: Proactive Outreach Campaign Monitoring Dashboard

## 1. Project Scope

This document provides a detailed cost, effort, and timeline estimation for the development of a new dashboard to monitor member-facing proactive outreach campaigns. The dashboard will provide key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights into campaign effectiveness, member engagement, and conversion funnels.

## 2. High-Level Requirements

- **Data Sources Integration:** Ingest data from campaign platforms (e.g., Salesforce Marketing Cloud), member databases, and engagement tracking systems.
- **Key Metrics:**
    - Campaign Reach (Targeted, Delivered, Failed)
    - Engagement Rates (Opens, Clicks)
    - Conversion Metrics (e.g., Sign-ups, Downloads)
    - Member Funnel Analysis (from impression to conversion)
    - Unsubscribe/Opt-out Rates
- **Dashboard Features:**
    - Interactive visualizations and charts.
    - Filtering by campaign, date range, communication channel, and member segment.
    - Drill-down capabilities into raw data.
    - Automated data refreshes.
- **Technology Stack (Assumed):**
    - Data Warehouse: Snowflake
    - ETL/ELT: dbt
    - BI/Visualization Tool: Tableau

## 3. Work Breakdown Structure & Estimation

The project is broken down into the following phases and tasks. Effort is estimated in hours.

| Phase | Task | Effort (Hours) |
|---|---|---|

| | 1.1 Requirements Gathering & Finalization | 40 |
| | 1.2 Data Source Identification & Analysis | 30 |
| | 1.3 UX/UI Wireframing & Dashboard Mockups | 50 |
| | **Phase 1 Sub-total** | **120** |
| **Phase 2: Data Engineering (4 Weeks)** | | |
| | 2.1 Design Data Ingestion Pipelines (ETL/ELT) | 60 |
| | 2.2 Develop & Test Ingestion Pipelines | 100 |
| | 2.3 Design Data Warehouse Schema | 40 |
| | 2.4 Build Data Models & Transformations (dbt) | 80 |
| | **Phase 2 Sub-total** | **280** |
| **Phase 3: Dashboard Development (4 Weeks)** | | |
| | 3.1 Connect BI Tool to Data Warehouse | 20 |
| | 3.2 Develop Core Dashboard Visualizations | 120 |
| | 3.3 Implement Filters & Interactivity | 60 |
| | 3.4 Setup Data Refresh Schedules | 20 |
| | **Phase 3 Sub-total** | **220** |
| **Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (2 Weeks)** | | |
| | 4.1 Quality Assurance & Data Validation | 80 |
| | 4.2 User Acceptance Testing (UAT) | 40 |
| | 4.3 Deployment to Production | 20 |
| | 4.4 Documentation & Handoff | 40 |
| | **Phase 4 Sub-total** | **180** |
| **Total Gross Effort** | | **800** |

## 4. Cost Estimation

Costs are calculated based on the total gross effort of 800 hours.

### Gross Cost (Before AI Savings)

| Resource Type | Rate/Hour | Total Effort (Hours) | Total Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Offshore Contractor | $40 | 800 | $32,000 |
| Onshore Contractor | $150 | 800 | $120,000 |
| Offshore Employee | $20 | 800 | $16,000 |
| Onshore Employee | $100 | 800 | $80,000 |

### Net Cost (After AI Savings)

A productivity saving of 30% is applied due to the use of AI-powered development and data analysis tools.

- **AI Savings (Effort):** 800 hours * 30% = 240 hours
- **Net Effort:** 800 hours - 240 hours = **560 hours**

| Resource Type | Rate/Hour | Net Effort (Hours) | Gross Cost | AI Savings (30%) | Net Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Offshore Contractor | $40 | 560 | $32,000 | -$9,600 | **$22,400** |
| Onshore Contractor | $150 | 560 | $120,000 | -$36,000 | **$84,000** |
| Offshore Employee | $20 | 560 | $16,000 | -$4,800 | **$11,200** |
| Onshore Employee | $100 | 560 | $80,000 | -$24,000 | **$56,000** |

## 5. Summary

| Category | Onshore Employee | Offshore Employee | Onshore Contractor | Offshore Contractor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Total Timeline** | 12 Weeks | 12 Weeks | 12 Weeks | 12 Weeks |
| **Total Net Effort** | 560 Hours | 560 Hours | 560 Hours | 560 Hours |
| **Total Net Cost** | $56,000 | $11,200 | $84,000 | $22,400 |

## 6. Assumptions

- Required licenses for BI tools (e.g., Tableau) and data warehouse platforms are already available.
- Data sources have accessible APIs and necessary permissions will be granted in a timely manner.
- The project will be staffed with a dedicated team. The timeline assumes a sequential workflow; some phases may be parallelized to shorten the overall duration.
