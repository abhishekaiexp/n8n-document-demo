# Feature Specification: Real-time Campaign Dashboard Integration into Monthly Report

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for integrating real-time campaign dashboard results into the existing monthly report. The primary goal is to provide timely and comprehensive insights into campaign performance, enabling better decision-making and optimization of outreach efforts. By incorporating key real-time metrics, stakeholders will have a more accurate and up-to-date view of campaign effectiveness.

## 2. Key Metrics to Integrate
To provide a holistic view of campaign performance, the following key metrics from the real-time campaign dashboard will be integrated:
*   **Number of Messages Sent:** Total count of messages (e.g., emails, SMS, push notifications) dispatched during the reporting period.
*   **Number of Messages Opened:** Count of messages that have been opened or viewed by members.
*   **Number of Messages Responded To:** Count of positive responses or conversions, such as:
    *   A1C test scheduled confirmations.
    *   Completion of a specific form (e.g., health assessment, survey).
    *   Enrollment in a program or event.

## 3. Data Integration

### 3.1. Data Flow
*   **Source System:** Real-time Campaign Dashboard System (e.g., Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze, custom-built system).
*   **Destination System:** Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) or dedicated Reporting Database currently used for the monthly report generation.

### 3.2. Data Transfer Frequency
*   Data should be extracted and updated from the source system to the destination system at least **daily**. This ensures that the monthly report reflects near real-time performance data, capturing trends and recent campaign impacts.

### 3.3. Data Transfer Method
*   **Preferred Method:** Develop secure API endpoints (RESTful preferred) within the real-time campaign dashboard system for programmatic data extraction. This allows for direct, pull-based integration.
*   **Alternative Method (if APIs are not feasible):** Establish a secure, automated data pipeline utilizing SFTP or cloud storage integration (e.g., S3, GCS) for batch exports and imports.
*   **Data Integrity & Security:** All data transfers must adhere to strict data integrity checks (e.g., checksums, record counts) and security protocols (e.g., OAuth2 for API access, end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest) to comply with HIPAA and other relevant healthcare data privacy regulations.

## 4. Report Display

### 4.1. Location in Report
*   A dedicated section titled "Real-time Campaign Performance Overview" will be created within the existing monthly report. This section should be easily identifiable and logically positioned, possibly after executive summaries and before detailed program-specific reports.

### 4.2. Visualization
*   Metrics will be displayed using clear, intuitive visualizations to facilitate quick understanding and trend analysis:
    *   **Line Graphs:** To show trends over time for messages sent, opened, and responded to, especially over the month.
    *   **Bar Charts:** For comparative analysis across different campaigns, regions, or member segments (if applicable).
    *   **Numerical Summaries:** Key metrics will also be presented as absolute numbers and percentages (e.g., open rate, response rate) for precise quantitative assessment.
*   Visualizations should be interactive within digital report formats where possible, allowing drill-downs.

### 4.3. Filtering/Segmentation (Desirable)
*   The report should ideally allow for filtering and segmentation of results to provide more granular insights. This functionality will enable users to view campaign performance by:
    *   **Campaign Name/ID:** To isolate performance of specific initiatives.
    *   **Region:** To understand geographical variations in engagement.
    *   **Member Segment:** To analyze performance across different demographic or health-profile based member groups.
*   This capability is dependent on the availability and granularity of data from the source system.

### 4.4. Historical Data
*   Ensure that the integration maintains continuity with any existing historical campaign performance data. New data points should seamlessly extend existing data series, allowing for long-term trend analysis and year-over-year comparisons.

## 5. Backend Development

### 5.1. Data Transfer Mechanism (ETL/API Integration)
*   Develop robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes or direct API integrations to pull data from the real-time campaign dashboard. This includes:
    *   **Extraction:** Securely pull raw data using the agreed-upon method (API/SFTP).
    *   **Transformation:** Cleanse, standardize, and map raw data to the EDW schema. This may involve data type conversions, null handling, and merging related datasets.
    *   **Loading:** Load transformed data into the designated tables within the EDW/reporting database.

### 5.2. Data Aggregation & Storage
*   Implement logic within the EDW or as part of the ETL process to:
    *   Aggregate daily campaign performance data into monthly summaries required for the report.
    *   Store raw daily data for potential future detailed analysis or re-aggregation.
    *   Define appropriate data models and schemas in the EDW to support efficient reporting and querying.

### 5.3. Error Handling & Monitoring
*   Establish comprehensive mechanisms for error detection, logging, and alerting:
    *   **Error Detection:** Implement checks for data transfer failures, data corruption, and inconsistencies (e.g., missing records, invalid values).
    *   **Logging:** Detailed logging of all data transfer processes, including success/failure status, timestamps, and error messages.
    *   **Alerting:** Automated alerts (e.g., email, PagerDuty) to relevant teams (e.g., SRE, Data Engineering) upon detection of critical errors or data pipeline failures.

### 5.4. Scalability
*   Design the data integration and processing solution to be scalable, capable of handling:
    *   Increasing volumes of campaign data as new campaigns are launched or member base grows.
    *   Growing number of campaigns and metrics without significant performance degradation.
    *   Future expansion of reporting requirements.

### 5.5. Security & Compliance
*   Ensure that all aspects of data transfer, storage, and processing comply with:
    *   **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):** Strict adherence to protected health information (PHI) guidelines.
    *   **Industry Best Practices:** Encryption of data at rest and in transit, access controls (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC), regular security audits, and penetration testing.
    *   **Company's Internal Security Policies:** Alignment with organizational security frameworks.

## 6. Assumptions
*   The real-time campaign dashboard system provides documented APIs or secure export capabilities for the required metrics.
*   Existing monthly report generation tools/platform can consume data from the enterprise data warehouse/reporting database.
*   Necessary infrastructure (e.g., ETL tools, compute resources) is available for data pipeline development.

## 7. Future Considerations
*   Integration of cost data for ROI analysis.
*   A/B testing results integration.
*   More advanced predictive analytics based on campaign performance data.
